NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019 OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW
************************
7.1 MILLION PEOPLE IN NEED
************************
6.2 MILLION PEOPLE TARGETED
************************
BREAKDOWN OF PEOPLE REACHED AS OF JUNE 2019
************************
2.5 MILLION PEOPLE REACHED
************************
As of June, the United Nations and humanitarian partners have reached nearly 2.5 million people with humanitarian assistance, a total of 39 per cent of the 6.2 million targeted for aid in 2019.
************************
In June, the rainy season continued with flooding and windstorms impacting camps and camp-like settings, as well as the delivery of food assistance. The food security response was significantly scaled up in June and food assistance was prepositioned in areas at risk of getting cut off from aid during the rainy season. Partners also provided increased agricultural
************************
assistance to support displaced and host communities ahead of the crucial time of the planting season.
************************
The new Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis exercise was also updated in June. More than 25 Sector partners participated in this assessment, which showed an increase of 300,000 people who are food insecure. As a result, the total number of people facing food insecurity in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states went up to 3 million people from 2.7 million previously projected for the same time period (June to August 2019) in the last CH analysis conducted in October 2018. As of June 2019, around 2.1 million people have received food security assistance, a significant increase from the 1.3 million reached at the end of
************************
A total of 128,674 cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) have been recorded since January. The nutrition situation is likely to worsen due to poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, especially in host communities; disease outbreaks such as measles; and the influx of newly displaced populations specifically in Damboa LGA of Borno State. New arrivals typically reach locations with poor nutrition and need immediate screening and treatment. Lack of funding, especially for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition, is hampering the response. This deficit leaves partners to only target areas that are extremely vulnerable. By the end of June, less than 20 per cent of those identified in need of nutrition assistance have been reached.
************************
On 18 June 2019, the Adamawa State Government officially declared an outbreak of cholera in three LGAs namely Yola North, Yola South and Girei. The total number of cases reported as of 18 June stands at 76 cases with one death. The total number of cases reported as of 31 July, 2019 stands at 457, with four deaths (CFR=0.87 %).
************************
There is an urgent need to scale up health services for new arrivals as existing response capacities are overwhelmed. Health partners are also facing access challenges, which pose concerns especially in the event of disease outbreaks.
************************
In June, population movements across Borno and Adamawa states continued with a total 10,153 new arrivals and 3,753 departures recorded across various tracking locations. The highest number of arrivals were recorded in Askira/Uba LGA and Bama LGA of Borno State.
************************
In 2019, the United Nations and partners are appealing for $848 million for 183 projects to be implemented by 69 humanitarian organisations. It is the seventh largest single-country appeal globally. As of 30 June 2019, halfway through the year, only 32.3 per cent ($274.2 million) of the funding appeal has been received, according to the Financial Tracking Service (FTS). Additional financial support is urgently needed to reach the 6.2 million people targeted for humanitarian aid in 2019.

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019 FOOD SECURITY
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
The food security response has been significantly scaled up in June and assistance was prepositioned in areas at risk of getting cut off from aid during the rainy season. Partners also provided increased agricultural assistance to support displaced and host communities ahead of the crucial time of the planting season. As of June 2019, around 2.1 million people have received food security assistance, a significant increase from the 1.3 million reached at the end of May. Of the total reached, 56 percent received food assistance and the remainder agriculture and livelihood support.
************************
More specifically, following extensive risk assessment and community sensitisation, partners completed a food distribution in Rann, Kala/Balge LGA of Borno State that began in May 2019. A total of 28,540 individuals received one month’s worth of food rations, reaching 95 percent of people planned for. Community members expressed concern that they will lack access to food during the rest of the rainy season when partners will be unable to distribute food assistance. In addition, the Government also distributed 15-20 day rations of cereals and oil. In Damboa LGA of Borno State, partners continued to provide 15-day rations to 10,440 individuals in Damboa town who lack proper shelter for food storage at household level, in addition to the existing caseload of over 28,000 individuals.
************************
In Yobe and Adamawa states, Sector partners completed a joint food and seed distribution during the rainy season. The same is ongoing in Borno State. By June 2019, more than 120,000 households across Borno, Yobe and Adamawa (BAY) states have received rain-fed crop and vegetable seeds as well as farming inputs. Frontline extension agents received training on proper agricultural practices in June. Partners distributed fliers to communicate important extension information to farmers.
************************
Access to sufficient land remains a challenge due to military restriction, particularly in Monguno LGA of Borno State. Joint advocacy efforts continue to call for the Government to ensure that farmers and pastoralists have safe and secure access to sufficient land. In addition, high- level advocacy is ongoing at both Maiduguri and Abuja levels to unblock the fertilizer movement restriction imposed by the Office of National Security Adviser (ONSA).
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
The new Cadre Harmonisé (CH) analysis exercise (June update), to which more than 25 Sector partners participated, shows an increase of 300,000 food insecure people, with an estimated 2.97 million people in the BAY states face food insecurity at both the Crisis and Emergency situation levels (IPC Phase 3 and 4) from June to August 2019, compared to 2.7 million previously projected for the same time period (June to August 2019) in the last CH analysis conducted in October 2018. The results were presented to all stakeholders in Abuja on 18 June. Approximately 59 per cent of the food insecure population resides in Borno State alone. Ongoing conflict has disrupted economic activities and access to basic services and markets. Despite an increase in the production of staple foods and cash crops combined with a decrease in the prices of these staples across the BAY states, there are pockets of highly food insecure areas; populations are unable to access farmland and have depleted their food stocks due to the conflict.
************************
The results of the April 2019 Emergency Food Security Assessment and CH analysis also indicate a deterioration of the food security situation as compared to a year ago. As such, an immediate scale-up of emergency food assistance is required in Magumeri, Mobbar, Nganzai, Askira/Uba, Biu, Kaga and Gubio LGAs in Borno State during the lean season, as well as adjustments reverting to unconditional food assistance in a few LGAs in Yobe in July. The results confirm that a reduction in assistance will not be possible post lean season (October). The Sector and partners will continue to advocate to the Government for intervention in areas that are not covered, such as Biu and Askira Uba LGAs.
************************
In June, a memo was released following the Joint Analysis Workshop on hard-to-reach areas of Borno State held among Sector partners held in April. The document captures collective conclusions, including the National Program for Food Security (NPFS) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the National Bureau of Statistics. ◼

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
In June, Nutrition Sector partners focused on improving nutrition monitoring, scaling-up the nutrition response to close gaps in Bama and Damboa hotspot areas and re- establishing services in Rann, Kala/Balge LGA of Borno State which is now accessible.
************************
A total of 128,674 cases of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) have been admitted since January, approximately 48 per cent of the annual target. In Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states, the Nutrition Sector identified and newly admitted 22,826 children under five years with SAM to 597 Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) sites. Of these, 1,348 children were admitted to inpatient care centres for specialised treatment in the 34 nutrition stabilization sites in the BAY states.
************************
Sector partners provided special supplementary food for treatment and prevention of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) to 108,350 children under five years and 60,086 pregnant and breastfeeding women. This included targeting children ages six to 23 months with interventions targeting all the IDP camps.
************************
In June, Nutrition partners collectively screened 1,855,780 children under five, enabling partners to identify and treat cases of malnutrition. Strengthened community engagement activities and the integration of screenings across other activities led to this achievement.
************************
To prevent acute malnutrition, nutrition partners reached 75,475 caregivers of children under two years with infant and young child feeding (IYCF) behavioural change communications including counselling and mother-to- mother support groups. In addition, 20,811 children under two years received multi-micronutrients powders (MNPs) to prevent micro-nutrient deficiencies.
************************
Additionally, some 21,578 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers of children 6-23 months received cash assistance in the amount of 5,000 Naira per month through cash-based transfers to facilitate their access to locally available foods that improve maternal, infant and young child feeding practices. The project is targeting 44 health facilities in seven LGAs of Borno State (MMC, Jere, Konduga, Biu, Bayo, Kwaya Kusar and Shani).
************************
The Nutrition Sector successfully established stabilization centres in Banki (Bama LGA) and Mafa of Borno State, which are both areas that had major gaps in the response. Nutrition services were re-established in Rann and 364 SAM and 561 MAM cases have already been treated using simplified treatment protocols.
************************
The main challenges facing the Nutrition Sector include: poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, especially in host communities; disease outbreaks such as measles; and the influx of newly displaced populations specifically in Damboa. New arrivals typically reach locations with poor nutritional status, needing immediate screening and treatment. Lack of funding, especially for the treatment of MAM, is hampering the response. This deficit leaves partners to only target areas that are extremely vulnerable. By the end of June, less than 20 per cent of those identified in need of nutrition assistance have been reached.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
In the coming months, the Nutrition Sector will focus on conducting in-depth, area-based gaps analysis. The analysis will help identify emerging gaps and ensure they are filled immediately. It will also be used to improve the quality of the response to reach and/or surpass the National, SPHERE and other relevant standards.
************************
The Sector will strengthen its collaboration with other sectors including WASH, Livelihoods, Protection and Health to ensure the following: all nutrition centres have adequate WASH facilities; affected populations receive sensitizations on hygiene and sanitation; households with malnourished children have access to livelihood programmes; all health workers providing nutrition services are trained on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and gender-based violence (GBV); and all children screened for malnutrition are referred onward to health centres for
************************
The Sector will also strengthen coordination at the LGA level and improve the quality of services by increased monitoring in the deep field with frequent joint monitoring exercises. ◼

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
By the end of June 2019, the Protection Sector reached 260,000 individuals with life-saving protection assistance across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states. In June alone, Protection partners extended services to 30,760 IDPs, Returnees, Host community members and other stakeholders (11,127 women, 6,372 girls, 6,199 boys, 5,895 men, 479 elderly women and 688 elderly men) in IDP camps and host communities providing capacity building services, protection-based material assistance, and community- based initiatives.
************************
A total of 7,315 individuals (3,259 girls, 3,553 boys, 160 women and 343 men) received legal documentation including birth certificates and national ID Cards, while 575 individuals (295 women and 280 men) received legal aid including legal counselling and advice (non-litigious), legal representation in court and solutions to eviction. Five LGAs in Borno State (Mobbar, Monguno, Dikwa, Gwoza and Biu) accounted for 80 per cent of documentation and legal aid
************************
The Protection Sector Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) held its inaugural meeting in June. Both the SAG and Sector Terms of Reference are currently under review, to facilitate a more strategic and inclusive direction across the BAY states. The Sector also met with the ECHO Regional Protection Adviser to discuss the protection needs of IDPs and key challenges that partners face to reach the people in
************************
In June, the Housing, Land and Property (HLP) Sub-Sector supported 375 individuals (246 women and 129 men) with Cash-for-Rent interventions. To date, a total of 2,971 individuals in Konduga, Jere and Maiduguri LGAs benefitted from these interventions. Land documentation was replaced for 220 households from Konduga LGA, and the Sub-Sector organized a four-day HLP capacity building training for 50 officers from the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Yobe State Command. The Sub-Sector also trained 25 staff of the Yobe State Ministry of Land and Housing in collaborative dispute resolution for HLP issues.
************************
The Mine Action Sub-Sector conducted Explosive Ordnance Risk Education sessions for 10,760 civilians (2,469 girls; 3,981 women; 2,656 boys and 1,654 men) in Bama, Damboa,
************************
Jere, Kaga, Konduga, Madagali, Maiduguri, Michika, Monguno and Ngala LGAs of Borno State and a risk education Training of Trainers for 14 staff from civil society. In total, 27 members of the Nigerian Police Force and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence personnel participated in a first responder training, which educated them on how to 1) respond to explosive-related incidents and 2) manage sites where an explosive item has been reported.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
As part of its mid-year reflection on progress and challenges ahead, the Protection Sector will prioritize three key strategic areas:
************************
Adopt a standardized monitoring system to better collate information and carry out evidence-based protection analysis.
************************
Establish a rapid protection assessment mechanism to respond to and predict emergency situations in a timely manner.
************************
Reinforce field presence while concurrently investing in the expansion of remote response through community-based protection
************************
In the coming month, the HLP Sub-Sector will develop a tool to monitor cash-for-rent interventions, including a set of questions to identify whether these interventions are reducing threats of eviction.
************************
An incident involving improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Konduga LGA on 16 June claimed the lives of 40 civilians and injured 30 others. Two civilians were also killed and two more were injured by explosive remnants of war (ERW). These types of incidents indicate the need for continued risk education for communities-at-risk to adopt safe behaviours.
************************
The Mine Action Sub-Sector will continue raising awareness of the threat that explosive hazards pose on civilian communities and humanitarian actors. With the onset of the rainy season, the Mine Action Sub-Sector foresees potential movements of ERW which might impact humanitarian operations, specifically those aiming at assisting IDPs voluntarily returning to their homes. ◼

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019 GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE PROTECTION (Sub-Sector)
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
The GBV Sub-Sector held consultations to revise the Gender- Based Violence Standard Operational Procedures (GBV SOPs) and Sector Strategy Revision process in Maiduguri for partners in Borno State, and in Yola for partners in Adamawa and Yobe states. Over 150 participants participated in the consultations, including key GBV stakeholders from police and law enforcement, justice institutions, health, mental health and psychosocial support, GBV Case Management, Food Security and Livelihoods, among others. The Spotlight Initiative, a partnership between the UN and the EU to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls was launched in Adamawa State, in support of the humanitarian- development nexus. The first ever inter-agency pilot rollout of the Primero/GBVIMS+, with tools to support incident monitoring and case management has also been launched. The Gender-Based Violence Information Management
************************
System (GBVIMS) enables those providing services to GBV survivors to effectively and safely collect, store, analyse and share data related to reported incidents of GBV.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
The Sub-Sector will organize strategic meetings for stakeholders on 15 July 2019 in Abuja and 18 July 2019 in Yola, Adamawa State through the platform “Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence” from the onset of emergencies.
************************
With support from the GBV Area of Responsibility, GBV partners will organise capacity building on coordinating GBV in emergencies for field focal points across the BAY states.
************************
Lastly, the Sub-Sector will facilitate its operational mid-year review meeting with partners in Borno State. ◼
************************
CHILD PROTECTION (sub-sector)
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
Sub-Sector partners trained 67 child protection workers (29 women and 38 male) working in 14 agencies in Borno State on grave child rights violations to enhance their knowledge and skills on monitoring and reporting of these violations. Child protection workers in Adamawa and Yobe states will receive training in the latter half of 2019.
************************
The Sub-Sector assigned agencies as child protection focal points at the LGA level in Bama, Banki (Bama LGA), Dikwa, Bama (excluding Banki), Gwoza, Pulka (Gwoza LGA), Konduga, Magumeri, Damasak (Mobbar LGA) and Ngala. The assignment of agency focal points aims to enhance the efficiency and quality of the child protection response at the field level. Terms of reference for the LGA focal point agencies were finalized and an orientation conducted for the six organizations that have so far taken up the role; focal
************************
points for the remaining LGAs will be determined gradually based on partner presence and needs.
************************
The Sub-Sector conducted a technical support mission for child protection actors in Yobe State; a key need for child protection partners in Yobe is technical support on case management. It was agreed that the Borno Case Management Task Force and the Child Protection Sub- Sector Coordinator will conduct support visits to Yobe State for this purpose.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
The Child Protection Sub-Sector will conduct training on family tracing and reunification (FTR) to increase the human resource capacity for FTR in the BAY states. The development of common messages on child protection will continue and these will eventually be translated into local languages following field tests. ◼

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
On 18 June 2019, the Adamawa State Government officially declared an outbreak of cholera in three LGAs namely Yola North, Yola South and Girei. The total number of cases reported as of 18 June stands at 76 cases with one death (CFR=1.32%). Yola North has 44 cases with one death (CFR= 2.27%); Girei has 31 cases with no deaths (CFR=0%) and Yola South has one new case. The local coordination forum within the Yola North secretariat for the three LGAs is active.
************************
Advocacy visits to all affected wards in Girei and Yola North are ongoing. Community health workers and informants are actively engaging with affected communities to detect cases and raise awareness. The Health Sector trained 30 community informants on “early detection and reporting” of cholera outbreaks in the three most-affected LGAS of Adamawa State. Early detection and reporting are crucial to containing cholera outbreaks and controlling disease transmission. Health partners are supporting the Adamawa State Government by coordinating house-to-house case searches to identify suspected cases of cholera.
************************
In Borno State, key preparedness activities are ongoing to mitigate the risk of a potential cholera outbreak including prepositioning kits and supplies needed to detect and diagnose cases. Health partners trained laboratory personnel on sample collection, packaging and transportation in key hotspot locations across Borno State. Health workers are also sensitizing and raising awareness of risks in all high risk communities, while partners are training volunteers on community surveillance and case detection to facilitate a rapid follow up of suspected cholera or acute water diarrhoea cases. The Health Sector is also developing the capacity of health workers to prepare and respond. Partners are advocating for immediate rapid diagnostic tests for all suspected cases and safely sending samples to the lab for confirmation. Raising awareness amongst the public on causes and symptoms of cholera is crucial to reducing
************************
The Health Sector is facing challenges to provide health services in locations across Borno State where there are many new displacements.
************************
There is an urgent need to scale up health services for new arrivals as existing response capacities are overwhelmed. Health partners are also facing access challenges, which pose concerns especially in the event of disease outbreaks. New population displacements are also overcrowding existing camps, which increases risk factors for disease outbreaks. Poor water and sanitation conditions in many IDP camps across Borno State need to be immediately addressed by WASH and CCCM Sector partners.
************************
Measles cases are on decline after a robust reactive measles vaccination campaign in Borno State that vaccinated some 1.2 million children since the beginning of 2019. However, Acute Watery Diarrhoea cases (AWD) is on the rise due to the onset of the rainy season and weak sanitation and drainage systems in many IDPs camps and host
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
With the start of malaria season, the Health Sector recommends administering oral antimalarial medicine to children in areas with high transmission rates throughout the season. Control and prevention of malaria remains a key public health challenge in Borno State. The availability and the use of preventative measures, such as insecticide- treated bed nets, is suboptimal, as is accessibility to health facilities for diagnosis and treatment with artemisinin-based combination drug therapy.
************************
As the rainy season continues, the Health Sector will continue to address and response to health-related impacts, particularly in containing and preventing outbreaks of water borne diseases like cholera. However, moving forward, Health partners need additional financial resources from donors to maintain uninterrupted health services to prevent further deterioration of the health situation and mitigate risks of disease outbreaks. ◼

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019 WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
In June, the WASH Sector prioritized responding to the impacts of the rainy season. Heavy rains and flooding in some cases damaged latrines and bathing shelters in several areas including Dikwa and Ngala LGAs in Borno State. The damage is exacerbated by the type of materials and age of some of the facilities. Emergency repairs and decommissioning are ongoing but usable space remains a challenge for the construction of new facilities.
************************
The WASH sector organized a one-day workshop for partners to provide hands on, practical training for the cholera response. About 60 participants who attended will provide further training within their organizations. In response to the declaration of a cholera outbreak on 18 June 2019 in Adamawa State, Sector partners mobilized resources for household disinfection, the distribution of hygiene kits, water point chlorination and hygiene promotion for targeted prevention activities for three LGAs in Adamawa State. Partner presence and capacity is generally lacking in Adamawa State and an increase in cases will pose a significant strain on the already stretched presence and resources.
************************
Cholera preparedness coupled with rainy season planning is ongoing in Borno State, reinforced by LGA level stock mapping and harmonised reporting tools. Information, education and communication materials on cholera and behaviour change in both print and audio are being translated into local languages.
************************
In June, WASH Sector partners provided emergency support to more than 9,000 new arrivals in Damboa LGA of Borno State. Water trucking increased from 80m3 litres per day at the beginning of the month to approximately 150m3 litres per day towards the end of the month. Partners also distributed hygiene kits and constructed emergency latrines and showers. The WASH Sector trucked an additional 140m3 of water to Dalori 1 and Dalori 2 Camps in Maiduguri and six additional wells are being constructed to address water shortages in the camps.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
Funding remains a challenge with locations like Mafa, Bama, Banki (Bama LGA), and Rann (Kala/Balge LGA) of Borno State falling short with either no partners present or funds running out. Efforts are being made to bridge the gap but sustained resource mobilization is needed for

NORTH-EAST NIGERIA: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION UPDATE | 1-30 June 2019 SHELTER AND NON-FOOD ITEMS
************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
The Shelter Sector continued to provide shelter and non- food items (NFIs) to internally displaced people to meet their immediate and longer-term needs.
************************
A total of 3,793 households received emergency shelter support including construction of communal and emergency shelters, and distribution of emergency shelter kits across Bama, Damboa, Dikwa, Gubio, Jere, Kaga, Magumeri, Maiduguri, Monguno and Ngala LGAs of Borno State. This brings the total number of households reached with emergency shelter assistance to 21,062 since January 2019. Of these, 242 households received housing repair interventions and 110 households received transitional shelter solutions bringing the total assisted to 1,732 households and 376 households respectively.
************************
Shelter partners constructed 36 partitioned communal shelters, each of which holds 16 households, in Damboa, Gubio, Maiduguri and Pulka (Gwoza LGA) of Borno State to accommodate a total of 576 households. Additionally, one communal shelter with a capacity of 16 households per shelter was constructed in Damboa. Partners are also rehabilitating six existing buildings in Bama LGA and five in Ngala LGA with the capacity to house 132 households and 56 households respectively.
************************
In June, 1,475 households received NFI kits that include basic and essential household items, including sleeping mats, blankets, jerry cans, soap, water disinfection tablets, sanitary pads and kitchen sets mainly in Damboa, Gubio, Gwoza, Jere, Maiduguri and Monguno LGAs of Borno State and Yola South LGA of Adamawa state, bringing the total households assisted since January 2019 to 19,713
************************
With the onset of the rainy and windy season, the Shelter Sector closely monitored damage to shelters; regular shelter repairs and reinforcements are ongoing. Flooding and windstorms affected a reported 441 households in Damboa,
************************
Mafa and Maiduguri LGAs that included damage to shelters, showers and latrines. Camp-based shelter maintenance and site management committees are supporting repair efforts, in addition to improving drainages and upgrading sites vulnerable to flooding.
************************
Further, the Sector made progress in obtaining additional land in Monguno LGA, Borno State for the construction of emergency shelters. Local authorities signed a letter of agreement authorizing the use of land for additional shelters, while the land owners agreed. The land is expected to be available for use starting in July. Despite this positive development, securing viable land for the construction of additional shelters to decongest camps and reception centres still continues to be a challenge. As of June, some 311,067 individuals require relocation to new sites, as 40 per cent of camps in Borno State are overcrowded.
************************
Sector partners conducted a mission to Yola to meet with the Adamawa State Shelter Sub-Sector to strengthen the local coordination mechanism, in order to better understand the needs of the IDPs in this location.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************

************************
Behind the numbers: response and constraints
************************
In June the Education Sector reached 32,000 people with Education in Emergency interventions, 97 per cent of which were children, across Borno, Yobe and Adamawa (BAY) states. Some 15 humanitarian actors and the state education ministries (SUBEB) contributed to this response.
************************
Specifically, partners constructed 79 Temporary Learning Spaces (TLS) in MMC, Dikwa and Gwoza LGAs of Borno State. In total, 8 classrooms were rehabilitated in Jere and Konduga LGAs, while 28 tents were set up as makeshift classrooms in response to education gaps in these LGAs. However, there is urgent need to construct an additional 50 TLS in MMC LGA to close the gap.
************************
In June, Temporary Learning Spaces with 30 classrooms and an administrative block became operational at the Mohammed Goni International Stadium Camp in Maiduguri. Partners enrolled a total of 1,561 children (817 girls and 744 boys) from the ages of six to twelve years for educational activities for nine months in preparation for the transition to formal schools. The teachers and children received learning materials based on weekly lesson plans.
************************
A total of 31,655 children (16,902 girls and 14,753 boys) received learning materials including Early Childhood Development kits distributed by six organizations. The programme distributed materials to internally displaced children in camps and schools hosting displaced communities to improve their learning abilities.
************************
Girls are facing specific challenges in accessing education in some LGAs like Damboa, Borno State due to long distances to school, an inadequate number of female teachers, an insufficient number of WASH facilities (especially gender- segregated toilets), and a lack of support from parents who may not see girls’ education as a priority.
************************
Partners trained 248 teachers in 19 LGAs across the BAY states in pedagogy and psychosocial support to provide teachers with the necessary skills to support children affected by conflict. These teachers oversee more than 12,000 learners in hotspot LGAs and include volunteers who teach in areas that lack qualified teachers and teachers from both displaced and host communities.
************************
Partners also trained 183 School-Based Management Committee (SBMC) members in Mubi North of Adamawa State and Potiskum, Damaturu and Gujba of Yobe State on school management, specifically on five main themes developed and approved by the Borno State Ministry of Education including: foundations for effective school governance, the basics of SBMCs, goals and structures of SBMC, roles and responsibilities of members, and the relationship between SBMC and parent-teacher
************************
The Education Sector completed its mapping of donor contributions to the education response by the end of June 2019. This mapping shows the amount of funding allocated to each actor in the Education Sector. It reveals a significant gap in funds designated for the emergency education response compared to the actual needs on ground. There is a strong imperative to mobilize additional funding for Education in Emergency interventions.
************************
The Education Sector also produced a dashboard providing an overview of indicators such as: the current response, targets reached, gaps, zones not covered, additional funding required, and actors involved in the education response. However, the Education Sector has only reached 17 per cent of its yearly target as of June 2019, significantly less than the 45 per cent goal initially set for June 2019.
************************
Looking ahead and bridging the gaps
************************
The Sector plans to conduct a response gap analysis in July, covering 10 hotspot LGAs in Borno State (Bama, Damboa, Dikwa, Gwoza Jere, Kodunga, Mafa, MMC, Monguno, and Ngala) to prepare a strategy to guide financial partners for fund allocation.
************************
After identifying LGA focal points, the Sector Coordination team will organize meetings at the state level in Yobe and Adamawa to improve community level coordination through the presence of state authorities in crisis zones. ◼
